# Linux User & Group Management Essentials

This project demonstrates core Linux commands for managing users and groups. It covers adding, modifying, and deleting user accounts and groups, along with changing file ownership.

---

## Commands & Concepts

* **`useradd`**: Create new users.
* **`usermod`**: Modify user properties (e.g., primary `-g` and supplementary `-G` groups). Use `-a` with `-G` to append.
* **`chown`**: Change file/directory ownership.
* **`userdel`**: Delete user accounts.
* **`groupdel`**: Delete groups.
* **`sudo`**: Execute commands with superuser privileges.

## Scenario Highlights

The provided command examples illustrate:
* Creating user `researcher9`.
* Assigning `researcher9` to the `research_team` primary group.
* Correcting syntax for adding users to supplementary groups (`sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9`).
* Changing file ownership for `project_r.txt`.
* Deleting user `researcher9` and the `researcher9` group (if it exists and is empty).

## Key Takeaways

* Always use `sudo` for administrative tasks.
* Pay close attention to command syntax (spacing, options).
* Ensure groups exist before assigning users to them.
* Understand primary vs. supplementary groups.
